/*! \file str.c
 *  \brief Definitions of the string methods.
 *  \author Peter Chapin <spicacality@kelseymountain.org>
 *  \date October 16, 2024
 *  \warning This code has not been extensively tested!
 *
 * The abstract type string is a C implementation of a dynamic string type. If you use the
 * methods defined here to manipulate string objects, strings will take care of their own memory
 * management, growing and sometimes shrinking as necessary to hold whatever data is put into
 * them.
 *
 * These strings have value semantics. When a copy of a string is made, the new string is
 * independent of the original. These strings can hold any data, including embedded null
 * characters. Strings without embedded nulls can be converted into a traditional C-style
 * pointer to char. The string can even be modified after the conversion provided that no
 * attempt is made to change its size.
 *
 * Ordinarily the methods of string return a value zero if they are successful. If they fail,
 * for example due to a lack of memory, they return -1. In that case they leave target objects
 * unmodified unless otherwise stated. Some methods assign other meanings to their return
 * values. Those meanings are explicitly documented with the method.
 *
 * Attempts to access a string using an out of range index causes undefined behavior. A future
 * version of this module may support some form of bounds checking, perhaps activated as a
 * compile time option.
 *
 * This implementation of strings is fairly standard. More memory is typically allocated for a
 * string than the string actually needs. When the extra memory is consumed, the total
 * allocation is doubled. This approach yields amortized constant time for the basic append
 * operation.
 *
 * These strings are currently not reference counted. Each string is maintained independently of
 * the others. This is easier to implement correctly, particularly in a multithreaded situation,
 * than reference counting.
 *
 * TO DO:
 *
 * + Review the formatted copy and append functions. Their handling of dynamic memory is not all
 *   that it should be. See the comments in the functions for more information.
 *
 * + Review the code for thread safety. Document findings (or fix unsafe parts).
 *
 * + Implement the other four relational operators.
 *
 * + Consider changing to a reference counted implementation. Watch thread safety issues.
 *   (Probably should document performance characteristics first to be sure such a change is
 *   worthwhile)
 *
 * + Write a decent test program.
 *
 * + Rewrite string_find_char() using a memory search function.
 *
 * + Consider implementing a more sophisticated string search algorithm in string_find_string().
 *
 * + Considering implementing some additional operations (Reverse string searches? Character
 *   replacement?)
