//! Type for doing I/O of a file on a bit-by-bit basis.
/*!
 *  Certain applications need to read or write files on a bit by bit basis. This type
 *  facilitates such activities. The precise order in which the bits are stored into each byte
 *  of the bit file (ie from bit 0 toward bit 7 or the other way around) is not specified in
 *  this interface. However, files written with put_bit( ) will produce the bits in the same
 *  order when read with get_bit( ).
