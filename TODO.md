Spica TODO List
===============

+ Add the check program to the Visual Studio solution. Note that right now the C check program
  uses the CUnit test framework. Some serious thought should be given to dropping that. Since
  Spica is intended to be cross platform a better cross platform solution should be used.
  Question: Can CUnit be used on Windows without too much pain?
